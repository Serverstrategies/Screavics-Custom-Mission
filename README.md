Screavics-Custom-Mission
========================

Based off the mission provided by Ahoy World and a few other great talented scripted individuals.

Credits these  are the base missions/scripts I chose:
Base Mission: <a href='http://www.ahoyworld.co.uk/'>Ahoy World</a>
<a href='http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=18751'>GrenadeStop by Bake (tweaked slightly by Rarek)</a>
<a href='http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?148085-BTC-Revive'>=BTC= Revive</a>
<a href='http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?148959-BTC-TK-punishment-script'>=BTC= Team Killer Punisher</a>
<a href='http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=19048'>Sub_radio made by Subroc</a>
And the many great editors that provide their solutions for free on the internet.

Put it in %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Arma 3 Alpha\missions\ or %USERPROFILE%\My Documents\Arma 3 Alpha - Other Profiles\[USERNAME]\missions\ to be able to edit this mission yourself.

If you would like to just play the mission put the PBO file in the Arma 3\MPMissions folder
